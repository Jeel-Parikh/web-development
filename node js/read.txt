Before installing any npm modual first time if you are installing new modual in directory then run "npm init" this will make package.json file which have all dependences
This is help ful when we share our project with oter person we share only package.json file with other html,css and js file and then other user will run only 
"npm install" then system automatically download all dependencies writen in package.json file

use "npm install <package-name>" or "npm i <package-name>" to install npm modual locally is will make node_moduals directory and put all moduals in that folder
use "npm install -g <package-name>" to install modual globally in my case it will sore at " C:\Users\anjali\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\"
